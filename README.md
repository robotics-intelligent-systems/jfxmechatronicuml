## Roadmap stages

 Manyfold is an open source, self-hosted web application for managing a collection of 3d models, particularly focused on 3d printing. Open Source Circuit Board Design Software that runs on the browser and desktop. CADmelia is an open-source CAD tool for creating 3D CAD models. Chili3D is an open-source 3D CAD software that runs directly in modern web browsers. CadQuery is an intuitive, easy-to-use Python module for building parametric 3D CAD models. CADCloud is a cloud based sharing infrastructure dedicates to CAD engineers. The FreeCAD MCP (Model Control Protocol) provides a simplified interface for interacting with FreeCAD through a server-client architecture. Mechatronic is a Workbench for FreeCAD that allows the modification of parametric models that includes and simplify the assembly and composition. CasADi is a symbolic framework for numeric optimization implementing automatic differentiation in forward and reverse modes on sparse matrix-valued computational graphs. It supports self-contained C-code generation and interfaces state-of-the-art codes such as SUNDIALS, IPOPT etc. It can be used from C++, Python or Matlab/Octave. The DLR URDFModelica Library is an open-source library for simulation of robots described as URDF. Library for modelling of Delta Robots. ROS 2 packages for the ROBOTIS OpenMANIPULATOR platform provide the necessary interfaces and tools to control the robot, integrate with its sensors, and develop physical AI applications. Modular HHCM app will genereate URDF, SRDF and a complete ROS package, which can be used to simulate and control the robot. Data processing programs for the vision-based tactile sensor FingerVision. BigFDM is an open source large scale 3D printer. GoodEnoughCNC Hybrid (Plasma, Mill) - very low cost and simple, suitable for everyone. The Real-Time Robot Arm Simulator is an open-source project creating a KUKA KR 700 PA-inspired virtual robotic arm using Blender and Python/Rust
