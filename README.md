## Roadmap stages

MechatronicUML is a Model-Driven Software Development tool-chain for cyber-physical systems. RCE is an open-source, distributed, workflow-based integration environment. Engineers and scientists use it to design and simulate complex systems (e.g., aircraft, ships, or satellites) by integrating their own design and simulation tools. OpenExo, an open-source exoskeleton platform for mobility and rehabilitation research. The development of efficient simulation tools to model the humanoid robot dynamics lies within the core of the WALK-MAN project. WALK-MAN simulator is based on Gazebo. The goal of CENTAURO is building a “human-robot symbiotic system where a human operator is telepresent with its whole body in a Centaur-like robot, which is capable of robust locomotion and dexterous manipulation in the rough terrain and austere conditions characteristic of disasters.” From the look of things, Centauro shares the same kind of rugged capability we’ve seen in other IIT robots, like WALK-MAN. OpenROV is a DIY telerobotics community centered around underwater exploration & adventure. Scilab is a software for numerical analysis, with a high-level programming language for scientific computation. Modelica is an object-oriented language developed to easily describe models of dynamic systems that can be very complex. The SMArtInt Library is designed to integrate various artificial intelligence (AI) models seamlessly into Modelica-based simulation tools. ModelicaGym toolbox was developed to employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) for solving optimization and control tasks in Modelica models. Coselica Toolbox provides Xcos Modelica building blocks for modeling and simulation of electrical, mechanical, and thermodynamic systems. Modelica3D is a lightweight, platform independent 3D-visualisation library for Modelica.
