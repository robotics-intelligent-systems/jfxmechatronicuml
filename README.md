## Roadmap stages

 MechatronicUML is a Model-Driven Software Development tool-chain for cyber-physical systems. Open-source software developed to provide a framework that other research groups can use on the Mini Cheetah platform. The DLR URDFModelica Library is an open-source library for simulation of robots described as URDF. Library for modelling of Delta Robots. ROS 2 packages for the ROBOTIS OpenMANIPULATOR platform provide the necessary interfaces and tools to control the robot, integrate with its sensors, and develop physical AI applications. Modular HHCM app will genereate URDF, SRDF and a complete ROS package, which can be used to simulate and control the robot. Launchers for Gazebo simulation of the TurtleBot. OpenROV is a DIY telerobotics community centered around underwater exploration & adventure. OceanOne, a bimanual underwater humanoid robot with haptic feedback. Aquanaut is an unmanned underwater vehicle designed for long-distance cruising into a half-humanoid robot capable of carrying out complex manipulation tasks. Data processing programs for the vision-based tactile sensor FingerVision. OpenExo, an open-source exoskeleton platform for mobility and rehabilitation research. WALK-MAN simulator is based on Gazebo. From the look of things, Centauro shares the same kind of rugged capability weâ€™ve seen in other IIT robots, like WALK-MAN. BigFDM is an open source large scale 3D printer. GoodEnoughCNC Hybrid (Plasma, Mill) - very low cost and simple, suitable for everyone. Mechatronic is a Workbench for FreeCAD that allows the modification of parametric models that includes and simplify the assembly and composition. It also provides a library of functions with which to generate new parametric models to be included in the Workbench. Apache Ditto is a software framework for digital twins, a virtual representation of devices in the real world. Odoo's Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP) module is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline manufacturing processes
