## Roadmap stages

The DLR URDFModelica Library is an open-source library for simulation of robots described as URDF. Launchers for Gazebo simulation of the TurtleBot. OceanOne, a bimanual underwater humanoid robot with haptic feedback. Aquanaut is an unmanned underwater vehicle designed for long-distance cruising into a half-humanoid robot capable of carrying out complex manipulation tasks. MechatronicUML is a Model-Driven Software Development tool-chain for cyber-physical systems. ROS 2 packages for the ROBOTIS OpenMANIPULATOR platform provide the necessary interfaces and tools to control the robot, integrate with its sensors, and develop physical AI applications. Modular HHCM app will genereate URDF, SRDF and a complete ROS package, which can be used to simulate and control the robot. Data processing programs for the vision-based tactile sensor FingerVision. OpenExo, an open-source exoskeleton platform for mobility and rehabilitation research. WALK-MAN simulator is based on Gazebo. From the look of things, Centauro shares the same kind of rugged capability weâ€™ve seen in other IIT robots, like WALK-MAN. OpenROV is a DIY telerobotics community centered around underwater exploration & adventure. The SMArtInt Library is designed to integrate various artificial intelligence (AI) models seamlessly into Modelica-based simulation tools. ModelicaGym toolbox was developed to employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) for solving optimization and control tasks in Modelica models. Library for modelling of Delta Robots. BigFDM is an open source large scale 3D printer. GoodEnoughCNC Hybrid (Plasma, Mill) - very low cost and simple, suitable for everyone. Archimedes is a free and open-source CAD (Computer Aided Design) software. Odoo's Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP) module is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline manufacturing processes
